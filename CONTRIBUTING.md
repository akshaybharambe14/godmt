## How to contribute to GoDMT

#### **Did you find a bug or security vulnerability?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/averageflow/godmt/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/averageflow/godmt/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** of the input to be translated and the expected vs received output, or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* All changes that improve the project are welcome. We are an inclusive bunch here!

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Feel free to get started and make a PR when you feel it is ready. The CI checks should pass as a minimum.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Email me personally at jjbigorra@gmail.com

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

GoDMT is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

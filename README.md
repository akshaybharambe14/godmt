# Go Schema Converter

The goal of this repository is to provide a tool that can parse Go files that include `var`, `const`, `map`, `struct` and `type` into an abstract syntax tree, aka AST.

That AST will then be transformed into data models for several programming languages.

Comments will be carried over :)
